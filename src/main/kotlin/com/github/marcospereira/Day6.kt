     * Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on how to display the
     * ideal lighting configuration.
     * <p>
     * Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at 0,0, 0,999,
     * 999,999, and 999,0. The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given
     * as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair
     * like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.
     * <p>
     * To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you
     * in order.
     * <p>
     * For example: turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light. toggle 0,0 through 999,0 would
     * toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off. turn
     * off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights. After following the instructions,
     * how many lights are lit?
