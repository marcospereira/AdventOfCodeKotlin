     * much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa
     * ends up visiting some houses more than once. How many houses
     * receive at least one present?

     * For example:
     *
     *     - `>` delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting
     *       location, and one to the east.
     *     - `^>v<` delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including
     *       twice to the house at his starting/ending location.
     *     - `^v^v^v^v^v` delivers a bunch of presents to some very
     *       lucky children at only 2 houses.

     *       one direction and Robo-Santa going the other.
