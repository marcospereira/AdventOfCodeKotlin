    /**
     * Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect
     * [right rectangular prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid)),
     * which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little
     * easier: find the surface area of the box, which is `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`.
     * The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the
     * smallest side.
     *
     * For example:
     *     - A present with dimensions `2x3x4` requires `2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52`
     *       square feet of wrapping paper plus `6` square feet of slack, for a
     *       total of `58` square feet.
     *     - A present with dimensions `1x1x10` requires `2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42`
     *       square feet of wrapping paper plus `1` square foot of slack, for a
     *       total of `43` square feet.
     *
     * All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many **total square feet** of
     * wrapping paper should they order?

     * ## Part Two
     *
     * The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width,
     * so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they
     * would again like to be exact.
     *
     * The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its
     * sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also
     * requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for
     * the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't
     * ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.
     *
     * For example:

     *     - A present with dimensions `2x3x4` requires `2+2+3+3 = 10` feet of ribbon
     *       to wrap the present plus `2*3*4 = 24` feet of ribbon for the bow, for a
     *       total of `34` feet.
     *     - A present with dimensions `1x1x10` requires `1+1+1+1 = 4` feet of ribbon
     *       to wrap the present plus 1*1*10 = 10 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a
     *       total of `14` feet.
     *
     * How many total **feet of ribbon** should they order?
