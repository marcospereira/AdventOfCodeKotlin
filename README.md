# Advent of Code in Kotlin

My solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## Why

Because I think it could be a funny way to learn more about Kotlin.

## How

Using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) with [Kotlin plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) and commenting the code with the puzzle descriptions. Also, this is supposed to be a learning exercise, so I will use some Kotlin features for the sake of experimenting.

## Running

To run all tests:

```bash
gradle clean test
```

To run all solutions:

 ```bash
 gradle
 ```
